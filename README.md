# Cumulocity IoT Alarm App

The Cumulocity IoT Alarm App seamlessly delivers alarms to your mobile phone, offering a comprehensive overview of all alarms raised on your Cumulocity IoT tenant. You can effortlessly browse or filter through the list of alarms, collaborate by adding comments, and modify the alarm's severity or status.

By utilizing this open-source application, you can significantly reduce the development time of your own application while benefiting from enhanced source code quality and reliability. The application provides a range of functionalities, including:

- Provides visibility of alarm available on the Cumulocity IoT platform,
- Alarms can be viewed, acknowledged and cancelled from the mobile device,
- Add comments on the alarms to add additional info and use it to collaborate within teams,
- Customize your alarm watchlist to filter alarms based on your specific preferences and priorities,
- Supports real-time push notifications for alarms on your watchlist.

**Note**: For enabling push notifications you will require two dedicated microservices to be deployed on your Cumulocity IoT tenant. [More Details](./microservices/README.md) 

## Building your own Application: Getting Started

This repository contains open-source code you can use to build the Alarm App for Android and iOS as well as to build the needed microservices for enabling push notifications.

- [How to build for iOS?](./ios/README.md)
- [How to build for Android?](./android/README.md)
- [How to build and deploy the microservices?](./microservices/README.md) 

The latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-alarmapp/releases/latest). 
![Workflow](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-alarmapp/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

The release contains binaries for Android and iOS:

- An unsigned `APK` file, which can be distributed to devices,
- An unsigned `IPA` file, which can be distributed, but must be signed before deployed to devices.

The latest build archive does not contain microservices. Some properties belong to your environment and must be configured before building the microservices.

## Give it a try

You can install the application on Android by downloading the `APK` file from the release.

**Downloading the APK**

- Visit the releases section of this GitHub repository and open the latest [release](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-alarmapp/releases/latest),
- Download the `APK` file.

**Installing the App**

- **Note**: Ensure that your device permits installations from unknown sources. You can activate this option in your device settings under `Security` or `Biometrics and security`,
- Once the `APK` file is downloaded, locate it in your device's file manager or download folder,
- Tap on the `APK` file to start the installation process,
- If prompted, confirm that you want to install the app from an unknown source,
- Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation,
- Once installed, open the app and enter a Cumulocity IoT tenant along with your user credentials and start exploring.

Alternatively, connect your mobile phone to a PC and drag the `APK` file on your phone.
